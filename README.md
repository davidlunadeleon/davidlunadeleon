# Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at ITESM in Monterrey. I love software development and learning, so I have a couple of repositories with experiments and material that I've used in my learning process.

## What I'm up to right now

On Github:

- Following the [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki to learn about React and have a better understanding of GraphQL and Node.js. [Repository](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/fullstackOpen2020).
- Doing some [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/davidlunadeleon/) problems to keep my data structures and algorithms knowledge in check. Currently, I'm trying to solve one problem per day. [Repository](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/leetcode).

Somewhere else:

- I'm currently reading [Git Pro](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub to learn a little bit more about git.
- I am also taking the [Introduction to Linux](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/) course by The Linux Foundation.

## My previous work

- Interned for a semester in Ternium and helped with data retrieval and normalization from an API for storage in SQL Server. Also worked with PowerBI to make analysis and reports.
- I did a Semestre i\* at my university where I got to work with a company building an API using Node.js, Express, MySQL and GraphQL. I got to experiment with AWS EC2 instances running on Linux to create test environments for the back-end and front-end teams. 
- I made a simple start page for Firefox and use it daily. It can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/startPage)

\*Note: Semestre i is a type of semester where students work with a company to solve a specific challenge. All courses are related to the challenge and most of the time is used to come up with a working solution. In my case, the challenge was IoT.

## About me

- Recently moved from Windows to Linux. I am currently learning about the OS to have a better understanding of it. My current setup uses Archlinux, i3wm, neovim, bash, and some other stuff. My dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/.dotfiles).
- I love the philosophy of Free and Open Source Software and am looking forward to contribute to the community and create my own projects that can be used by others.
- I like to play videogames. Currently playing Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy.
