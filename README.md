### Hi there, I'm David 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at ITESM in Monterrey. I love software development and learning, so I have a couple of repositories with experiments and material that I've used in my learning process.

### What I'm up to right now

- Taking the [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki to learn about React, GraphQL and Node.js. [Repository](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/fullstackOpen2020).
- Doing some [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/davidlunadeleon/) problems. Currently, I'm trying to solve one problem per day. [Repository](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/leetcode).
- Currently reading [Git Pro](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub to learn more about git.
- Also taking the [Introduction to Linux](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/) course by The Linux Foundation.

### My previous work

- Interned for a semester in Ternium. Data retrieval and normalization from an API for storage in SQL Server. Worked with PowerBI for analysis and reporting.
- Did a Semestre i\* where worked building an API using Node.js, Express, MySQL and GraphQL. Experimented with AWS EC2 instances running on Linux to create test environments for the back and front-end teams. 
- Made a simple start page and use it daily. It can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/davidlunadeleon/startPage)

\*Note: Semestre i is a type of semester where students work with a company to solve a challenge. Most of the time is used to come up with a solution and implement it. In my case, the challenge was IoT.
